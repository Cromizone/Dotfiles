#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

 font_size 10.0
#: font size (in pts)

#: Cursor customization {{{

#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

 cursor_shape_unfocused hollow
#: Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused. 
#: The unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline, hollow.

 cursor_blink_interval 0.50

 initial_window_width  150c
 initial_window_height 40c
#: If enabled, the OS Window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the OS Window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

 window_padding_width 3
#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
